An app to manage college systems has two sides: one for control, where they can add, remove, edit, and see all the information about a student and courses; the other is for students, where they can register for courses, edit them, select the group, view the news that the control posted, and log out. All of the information is saved in a data base file (file.db), which the programme can access.
